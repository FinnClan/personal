Questions on Assignment 2

Question 1:
Ask about LibrarianView constructor, why does LibrarianView
have parameters (IModel model, String classname) when the class we are
looking at for help, i.e. TellerView, TellerView only has a constructor
with one parameter (IModel model)

Question 2:
How should we write stateChangeRequest(...) in the Librarian class?
Similar to Teller?
